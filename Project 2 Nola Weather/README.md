# Project 2: The Effect of Weather on Aaron Nola's Pitching.

# Description
This project analyzes the effect, if any, that temperature and humidity has on Aaron Nola's Game Score as well as his curveball spin rate.

# Organization
The data_files folder contains all of the data I read in for this project. Note that the data_files folder does not contain any data from 
Baseball Savant as I read in that data from my local database. The R_files folder contains all of the R scripts I used, with main.R being
my central script with the other scripts acting as helper functions that are called in main.R. The output_files contain all the graphs I 
made in R for this project.
