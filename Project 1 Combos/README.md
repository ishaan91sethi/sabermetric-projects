# Project 1: Best and Worst Pitch Type and Pitch Location Combinations.

# Description
This project examines the best and worst pitch type and pitch location combinations. The Data_files folder contains all the data
files I read in for the project and the R_files contain all of my R scripts. My main R scripts are combos_battedball_only.r and
combos_with_noncontact.r. The other scripts are either used for scraping data from Baseball Savant (in the scraping_files folder)
or called in these two main R scripts as helper functions.
