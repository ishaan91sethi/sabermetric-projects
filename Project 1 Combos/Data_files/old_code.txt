-These are the old variables I was looking at before pivotting to solely xwoba, with the SQL query I used below.

query_swstrike <- "SELECT pitch_type, zone, description, bb_type, launch_speed, estimated_woba_using_speedangle AS xwoba, p_throws AS p_side, stand AS b_side FROM statcast_data WHERE game_year == 2018 ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 100000"
